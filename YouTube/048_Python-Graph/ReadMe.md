    As a bonus from the video, there is a function, that works the way your TL would expect it:
      ```
      data = """
      2 5
      A B 1
      A C 5
      A D 10
      D P 15
      A P 100
      A 50
      A P
      """
      figure_object = generate_graph_plot(data)
      plt.show()
      ```
